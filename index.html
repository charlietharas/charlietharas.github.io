        <p>Hi! I hope you're having a good day. This is my website, which has some information about me and my life. Check it out:</p>
		<h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            <b>TL;DR</b>: I'll graduate with a BA in Computer Science & Mathematics from <a href="https://williams.edu" target="_blank">Williams College</a> in 2027.<span class="info-button" id="degree-button"><sup>â“˜</sup><span class="tooltip" id ="degree-tooltip"></span></span> And I'm definitely a liberal arts kid.

            <li><b>Comp sci:</b> I like computers.</li>
            <li><b>Math:</b> Although math is very pragmatically helpful in writing efficient code and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixl3nykKG9M&list=WL&index=10&t=9s&pp=gAQBiAQB" target="_blank">understanding our most advanced technology</a>, I'm more interested in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBnnXbOM5S4" target="_blank">why and how all these little things about the universe line up</a>. I think Fourier analysis is cool.</li>

Can we use computers to find out what thinking is? Can we use thinking to make better computers?</li>
            <li><b>Philosophy:</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizations_of_the_Dune_universe#Thinking_machines" target="_blank">Should we be using computers at all?</a> Do computers fundamentally conflict with the 'whole point' of the human experience, and are they intrinsically doomed to make life less fulfilling and meaningful? Or are they the key to understanding the universe?<span class="info-button" id="phil-button"><sup> <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/continuity" target="_blank">â“˜</sup></a><span class="tooltip" id ="phil-tooltip"></span></span></li>
            <li><b>Linguistics:</b> How do we communicate? How can we communicate better? Can we make machines that help? What is a language, and how do each of its features affect its failure to capture reality?<span class="info-button" id="ling-button"><sup> â“˜</sup><span class="tooltip" id ="ling-tooltip"></span></span></li>
            <li><b>Living Better:</b> Urbanism, civil engineering, human geography, social psychology, political science, economics--these all offer some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzBMAwZlVd8" target="_blank">pragmatic and easy ways</a> to help people live better (impractical, hard ways too).

                <li><b>Student developer</b> for <a class="blue" href="https://wso.williams.edu/about" target="_blank">Williams Students Online</a>: developing useful features on our student-led website like synchronizing our course scheduler with professor ratings and enabling easier searches for interesting classes.</li>
                <li><b>Research intern</b> for <a class="blue" href="https://www.mskcc.org/research-programs/msk-mind-multi-modal-integration-data" target="_blank">MSKCC MIND</a>: high school summer internship, worked on CV models to identify cell features, collaborated with data engineers to streamline the training pipeline for non-tech-savvy pathologists.</li>

        addListener('phil-button', 'phil-tooltip', '<p class="tooltip-text">There is a fundamental opposition between the discrete and the continuous--in physics, in math, in philosophy. Simplistically, the "natural world" is often thought of as continuous, while the human experience (perhaps most clearly seen by the language that we use to communicate it) seems inexhorably discrete. Computers, like us, are able to provide explanations and analyses for continuous behavior from a discrete viewpoint, and have thus been immensely helpful to scientific understanding. But can quantum information science take us even further? What would a theory of everything even mean?<br><b>TL;DR</b>: I am interested in the metaphysics of continuity.<br><i>Click for an interesting read</i>.</p>');
        addListener('ling-button', 'ling-tooltip', '<p class="tooltip-text">Many believe that language is fundamental to humanity, and until only a few years ago, it was thought that language would be near-impossible for computers to work with. But it isn\'t impossible. It\'s kinda easy.</p><div class="tooltip-text"><ul style="font-size:0.75em"><li>Does it mean something that language is so simple? Does this prove its critics in the history of literary theory and linguistics right? What might this say about the limits of our consciousness?</li><li>What else is that easy? How much stuff can we just encode in vectors? More broadly, much of the world can we describe mathematically?</li></ul></div>');
