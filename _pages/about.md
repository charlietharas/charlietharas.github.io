Hi! I hope you're having a good day. This is my website, which has some information about me and my life. Check it out:

# Education
TL;DR: I'm graduating with my bachelor's degree in CS + Math from Williams in 2027.
## Undergrad
**Williams College**, Williamstown, MA, 2023-2027 (Bachelor of Arts)

Anticipated double major in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a concentration in Cognitive Science. I'm currently participating in student computer science and research organizations, and conducting summer research on transportation patterns and microtransit solutions in the Berkshires. I've started TA-ing introductory computer science ([CSCI 136](https://www.charliemax.dev/teaching/csci136)) in my sophomore fall. I'm also very actively involved with the climbing team: I teach bouldering PE classes, host climbing facility open hours, participate on the administrative board of the student climbing team, and compete regionally in bouldering. On the side, I also play the classical/contemporary guitar (big fan of Leo Brouwer).

## High School

**Hunter College High School**, New York, NY, 2017-2023 (6-year program)

Imagine a liberal arts college, but as a high school. I did a lot of stuff, here's some of it:
- Was president of Computer Science Consortium, a competitive coding and general CS interest-based club.
- Volunteered at the writing center.
- Wrote articles for BITS, the computer science magazine.
- Worked as a [teaching intern](https://www.charliemax.dev/teaching/high-school) for 9th-grade computer science classes and our school's data science extracurricular.
- Worked with Hunter Data Analytics for Change on hackathon problems and planning.
- Took college classes at **Hunter College**, New York, NY, 2022-2023. (CSCI 23200 Relational Databases & PSYC 10000)

# Experiences
Here's a brief overview of some of the coolest stuff I've done. For a less brief overview, check out my [resume](https://charliemax.dev/resume.pdf), the list of [projects](https://charliemax.dev/projects) I've been working on, and my [experiences as a teaching assistant](https://charliemax.dev/teaching).
## Work
- Transportation researcher for [Williams Center for Learning in Action](https://learning-in-action.williams.edu/) over my freshman summer. Working  with a transit demand management coordinator from OHSU to study transit and mobility patterns in the Berkshires to brainstorm microtransit solutions for low density, poorly connected rural areas. Doing full stack dev of a carpool web application to serve Williams students and Berkshires residents. Looking forward to showing off what we get done at the end of summer! 
- Student developer for [Williams Students Online](https://wso.williams.edu/about) starting in my freshman year of college. Worked on front and back end (primarily with Go & React.js) to develop features for our student website, such as course schedule synchronization with both user accounts and Williams's course rating service, new feature flags for the course catalog, and good old bug fixes.
- Data engineering & bioinformatics intern for [MSKCC MIND](https://www.mskcc.org/research-programs/msk-mind-multi-modal-integration-data) in the summer of 2022. I debugged and documented their Luna platform on Unix machines, built models to identify cell features on slide data, and worked on a .svs viewer and annotator that could integrate into their model training pipeline.
- I also spend my summers working as a surf instructor at Rockaway Beach ðŸŒŠ.

## Volunteer
- I was on the national executive board of [Steel City Codes](https://steelcitycodes.org), a chapter-based nonprofit that provides computer science education to ~2000 students from underserved communities every year. Starting as a tutor in 2020, I became a chapter head in 2021, where I reached out to NYC school administrators to launch chapters at dozens of schools. In 2022 and 2023, I worked with the national executive team to organize several [hackathons](https://devpost.com/hackathons?search=steel%20city%20hacks) (total 500+ participants, $25K+ cash-value fundraised), partnered with [MRI Software](https://www.mrisoftware.com/) to bring SCC workshops to their company HQ in Cleveland, launch new after-school and summer camp programs, and build several new curriculum offerings.

## Teaching
- At Williams, I TA Data Structures & Advanced Programming (CSCI 136) with Prof. [Jim Bern](https://github.com/james-bern/website/wiki).
- At my high school, I taught lessons, wrote curricula, and assisted in classes for 9th-grade computer science (theory & introductory Python).
- Also at my high school, I taught lessons, wrote curricula, and assisted in classes for Science Research Seminar, our school's research and data analytics extracurricular for 10th-12th graders.
- I also taught a few semesters of introductory and intermediate classes at Steel City Codes (Python, Java, Git, Scratch, etc.).

## Projects
I love to analyze random data from my life (fitness, sleep, music history). I love to build machine learning models and play around with their applications (NLP chatbots, CV webcam models). I like to make games here and there (Unity, Java graphics). Not all of my work is public, since a lot is deeply tangled in my personal data with absolutely no privacy best practices involved, but I'm working on that!

For the sake of not having to keep these updated, just check out my [projects](https://charliemax.dev/portfolio).
