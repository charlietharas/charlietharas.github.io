Basic text generator adapted from another model. Trained on various book datasets with mixed/poor results. Used as a base model (though that one had tweaked params/hyperparams) for another NLP bot that I trained as a chatbot to entertain my friends over the pandemic. Mostly just an experiment for me to learn more about NLP models back in 9th grade.
