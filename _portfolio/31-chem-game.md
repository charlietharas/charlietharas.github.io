Game created to teach students about electron sublevel diagrams. It contains 36 levels corresponding to elements on the periodic table, Carbon being the one with the lowest atomic number and Radon the one with the highest. All of these atoms are in their ground state and no atoms that have odd atomic numbers are included.

The player will load into a random element, or a random element in a subcategory (transition metals, nonmetals, etc) and play through a short, easy platformer level. The level consists of circles from an Aufbau chart in the correct bottom-to-top height-ascending order. The horizontal access is not identical for each level/pertinent to the Aufbau diagram. Once the player beats the level, they will have the option to reveal the element that they just played.
