Winner for Trinity High School's Hacktrin VIII (2021) Best Overall award. Tracks finger position using webcam, then parses trace of finger writing in midair into letters using a model trained on EMNIST data. User can blink forcefully to reset tracking and move on to the next letter. A little gimmicky, but it actually works--though the full pipeline isn't yet on GitHub (working on it).
