Basic simulation of citizen agents in and around a model of New York City's subway system. Agents use walking transfers and trains to get around the city. Controls:
- 1/2 adjust the simulation speed
- P pauses
- T switches between train visualizations: all trains, only trains with lots of passengers, and no trains
- G switches between citizen visualizations: all citizens, citizens doing walking transfers, and no citizens
- C centers the camera and resets zoom
- E spawns citizens at the mouse pointer
- F pauses/resumes automatic citizen spawning
- Backspace clears all citizen agents
- R resets the entire simulation
- I shows/hides the help menu
